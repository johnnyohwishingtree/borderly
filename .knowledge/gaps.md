# Gaps

Findings from audits and pipeline runs. Fix stories resolve these and remove the entry.

## Code fixes

- E2E suite (`pnpm e2e`) — all failures caused by missing Playwright browser binaries. Webpack compiles successfully. Fix: run `pnpm exec playwright install` in an environment that allows CDN downloads (blocked in cloud/CI sandboxes). Not a code issue.
- Missing test coverage for utils: `constants.ts`, `logger.ts` — minimal logic, excluded from #1016. (audit-2026-03-26)
